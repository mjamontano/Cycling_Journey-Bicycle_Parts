    <td><b>Structural Design: </b>Different structural design will give us different ridiing positions, which has greater impact on the comfort of cycling.<br>
    <br>There are two ways to mark the frame size:<br>
    1) In <b>letters</b>: XS, S, M, and so on<br>
    2) Specific <b>values</b>: 15.5 inches, 17 inches, 19 inches, etc.<br>
    <br>NOTE: Even choosing a frame of the same number or letter, the specs of different brands may be different. The corresponding height range could be slightly different and cannot be generalized.<br>
    <br>If we choose the unsuitable frame size, it will not only affect the strength of the rider, make the cyling more laborious, but also easy to cause back pain, hand pain and other injuries.<br>
    <br><br><b>Frame Material: </b>An important reference to distinguish the luxury, mid-range and entry-lever bicycles.<br>
    <br>At present, there are mainly four types of bike frames on the market: <b>steel bike frame, aluminum bike frame, carbon fiber bike frame and titanium bike frame</b>. For different frame materials, its strength, corrosion resistance, and manufacturing costs are different. In addition, steel and aluminum are currently the most widely used materials for bike frames in the market, mainly because of the low manufacturing cost and mature processing technology.<br>
    <br><b>Steel frames</b> are usually used for entry-lever bicycles, <b>aluminum frames</b> are generally used for mid-range bikes, and <b>carbon fiber frames & titanium frames</b> are mostly used for luxury bicycles.</td>

      <br><br>There are rigid forks and suspension forks available. The <b>rigid forks</b> are generally used for urban bikes and road bikes and provide increased speed on flat surfaces, while the <b>suspension forks</b> are mostly used for mountain bikes and allow you to navigate harsh terrain whilst dampening and reducing the impact felt when tackling obstacles on the trail.<br>
      <br><br>The rigid forks are mainly made of <b>steels, aluminum, carbon fiber, and titanium</b>. The suspension forks mainly have material of <b>steel, aluminum, and magnesium alloy</b>.

    <br><br>There are two widely used braking ways: <b>rim brake and disc brake</b>. And the disc brake can be divided into <b>mechanical disc brake & hydraulic disc brake</b>.<br>
    <br><br>The <b>rim brake</b> is widely used on classic or vintage bicycles, but less used on modern bicycles. Compared with hydraulic disc brake, the <b>mechanical disc brake</b> has relatively low manufacturing cost, so price is cheaper. However, the brake performance of <b>hydraulic disc brake</b> is better and the handling is smoother and more consistent.<br>
    <br><br>The brakes are composed of <b>disc brake rotor (for disc brake), calipers, cable, and brake levers</b>. Generally the brake levers are combined with <b>gear shifters</b> to become a single pair of levers, which have the ability to control the brakes or change gears.<br>
    <br><br>In the past, <b>hub brakes</b> were common on city and commuter bikes. While riding a bike with a hub brake, pedal backwards and the hub brake (contained with the rear wheel's hub) will engage and slow you down.

    <br><br>The <b>hubs</b> are divided into <b>steel bearings & ceramic bearings</b>. The ceramic bearings are better in performance, roll somoother and create less rolling resistance with less friction.<br>
    <br><br>Most of the <b>spokes</b> on the market are commonly made of <b>steel</b>. Some manufacturers have also launched better <b>carbon spokes</b>, which have unmatched lightweight, stiffness, strength, and allows you to feel your bike more responsive with <b>higher stiffness-to-weight ratio</b>.<br>
    <br><br>When choosing a <b>bicycle tyre</b>, first of all, it is necessary to pay attention to the correct selection of <b>tyre size</b> to avoid being unable to install. Second, we should select the suitable <b>tread pattern</b> of tyres according to use.

    <br><br>Some older stems are called <b>quill stems</b> which expands when tightened inside the fork steerer tube.<br>

    <br><br>Grips tend to be made from textured rubber, which allows you to keep hold of your handlebars without having to squeeze too tight. Grips also help to <b>dampen vibrations</b>, increasing your steering control.<br>
    <br><br>Bar tape is much the same, it offers increased grip, cushioning and control of your handlebars. You'll probably want thicker, more cushioned grips or bar tape if you take long bike rides.

      <br>2) <b>Axle</b> - Runs through the center of the hub and sits upon the internal bearings, which allow it to rotate. There are two main types of hub axles, <b>quick release axles and through axles</b>. Axles also attach your wheel to the dropouts of your bike.<br>
      <br>3) <b>Ball Bearings</b> - Sit inside the hub shell cup and allow the wheel to rotate smoothly. If your wheel isn't rotating properly, then a likely cause of this is that your ball bearing are worn out.<br>
      <br>4) <b>Cones</b> - Found on adjustable hubs and work alongside lock nuts. Cones plays a part in tightening or loosening the hub's bearings. If your cone is too loose, the hub may have play in it, and if the cone is fitted too tightly, the wheel will not spin freely.<br>
      <br>5) <b>Lock Nut</b> - Used to lock the hub's cones win place after adjusting them to the correct level. Once the lock nut is tightened, it will hold the cone in place. However, be careful not to overtighten the lock nut as you may end up tightening your cone.

    <br><br>Before the invention of disc brakes, most bike rims had a flat braking surface that the brake pads squeeze to lower riding speed. Bikes that use disc brakes do not require a braking surface and instead use disc rotors that serve the same purpose.

    <br><br>There are three main types of bike tires:<br>
    <br>1) <b>Clincher Tires</b> - The vast majority of bicycles use clincher tires, which work in conjunction with and are attached to clincher rims by their two inner metal beads. An inner tube sits inside a clincher tire which is inflated before riding.<br>
    <br>2) <b>Tubular Tires</b> - Commonly used by road bikes and are designed for racing. Because tubular tires are glued to the rims, they aren't limited by the rim's sidewalls. This means tubular tires provide better shock absorption than clincher tires of the same size.<br>
    <br>3) <b>Tubeless Tires</b> - Can be fitted to most clincher wheels but may require a special rim strip to keep the tire airtight. As you probably figured, tubeless tires don't use an inner tube and are filled with sealant to encourage an airtight seal with the rim.

    <br><br><b>Presta valves</b> are mainly used by road bikes. Presta vales are thinner than Schrader valves and seal tightly on air pressure alone. This means they don't need to use a complex valve, reduing their overall weight.

      <td>Essential component of the bicycle drivetrain and is made up of a group of sprockets (cogs) located on the freehub of the rear wheel.<br>
      <br><br>These <b>sprockets</b> can be shifted through, increasing or decreasing the <b>torque</b> required  to pedal, subsequently affecting the bike's speed.<br>
      <br><br>Modern bicycle cassettes normally use between <b>8 to 11 sprockets</b>, whilst other cassettes are available with <b>5 to 13 sprockets</b>.

      <td>A vital bike part; as a point of contact, you sit on your saddle whilst riding.<br>
      <br><br>Saddles come in many shapes and sizes. Some saddles are wider, with <b>increased padding for extra comfort</b>, while others <b>focus on speed, minimizing padding and width</b> to keep weight to a minimum and avoiding thigh chafing.

      <br><br>On the saddle rails, you'll find fore and aft measurements. These are used to determine correct saddle positioning.

      <br><br>Seatposts are adjustable in height, allowing cyclists to optimise their bike's geometry to their desired riding position.<br>
      <br><br>When adjusting a seatpost, it's improtant to pay attention to minimum insertion markings on the seat post tube. Seat posts that are over-extended can easily damage a bicycle.
